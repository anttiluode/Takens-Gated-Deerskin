PREDICTION 5.4 — BATCH TEST ACROSS SUBJECTS
=============================================
Runs the topological complexity analysis on ALL EDF files in a directory,
aggregates results across subjects and runs.

Ran with eegmmidb 1.0 Dataset 

USAGE:
    python batch_runner.py (folder with eeg files) 
    python batch_runner.py . --pattern "S*R04.edf"   # only R04 runs
    python batch_runner.py . --sim                    # include simulation

The script finds all .edf files, runs the topology analysis on each,
then produces:
  - Per-file results
  - Per-subject averages (across runs)
  - Grand average across all subjects
  - Statistical test of the prediction across the full population
